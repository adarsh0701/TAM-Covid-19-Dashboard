# Data Visualization Project README

## Overview

This project aims to provide insightful visualizations of three primary datasets related to the impact of the epidemic on various aspects of individuals' lives, including mental health, coping techniques, family relationships, online class patterns, and more. Through the use of different data visualization techniques, we strive to offer meaningful insights into the datasets.

## Datasets

1. **Dataset 1**: Consists of student responses, focusing on how they have been affected by the epidemic, their coping techniques, preservation of family relationships, health difficulties, online class patterns, and attendance experiences.

2. **Dataset 2**: Contains replies from diverse groups regarding their mental health, daily activities, and altered routines due to the epidemic.

3. **Dataset 3**: Analyzes the mental health condition of countries based on the number of individuals searching for mental health keywords.

## Visualizations

Different visualization techniques have been utilized to represent various scenarios:

- **To examine attribute contribution and data item distribution**:
  - Stacked Bar Chart
  - Pie Chart
  - Donut Chart

- **To compare proportions between categories via area size**:
  - TreeMaps
  - Area Chart

- **To display the distribution of a single attribute or perform comparisons between categories**:
  - Bar Chart
  - Radial Bar Graph

- **To depict values for the main variable across two axis variables**:
  - Heatmaps

- **To visualize the distribution of numerical data through statistical analysis**:
  - Boxplots

## Interactive Dashboard
